## Description
This tool takes the results from a cargoscan and quickly puts it into Evepraisal, spitting back useful info.

**Features:**
* Automatic clipboard reading and posting to [Evepraisal](http://evepraisal.com)
* Works on nearly everything in-game, not just cargo scans

**Planned Features**
* Priority for important items at the top of the list (Plex, injectors, etc)
* More to come, submit an [issue](https://github.com/GunfighterJ/cargoscan/issues/new) with ideas!
