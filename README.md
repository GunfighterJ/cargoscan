## Description
This tool takes the results from a cargoscan and quickly puts it into Evepraisal, spitting back useful info.

**Features:**
* Automatic clipboard reading and posting to [Evepraisal](http://evepraisal.com)
* Works on nearly everything in-game, not just cargo scans
* Overlay mode keeps it on top and makes it transparent so you can focus on the game
* Ability to hide and resize the items window
* Customizable colors for value and volume based on preset limits you can define!

**Usage:**
* Run the program
* Optionally configure any settings you want
* Put into position over EVE
* Press the 'o' key to enable overlay mode

**Warning:**
* While the program is running it monitors your clipboard and sends any copy you make to evepraisal. Disable the program once you are done.

**Planned Features**
* Priority for important items at the top of the list (Plex, injectors, etc)
* More to come, submit an [issue](https://github.com/GunfighterJ/cargoscan/issues/new) with ideas!
